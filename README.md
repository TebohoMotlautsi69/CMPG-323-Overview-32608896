##### Table to explain Project and Respository

| Projects are issue management feature used to organise issues in a boradview or table view(view).| Repository is like a folder containing all project documentation.         |                                                                         |             

Repositories are linked to project by selecting the repository you are trying to link from the table view of the project on the right hand side drop down field of repository.

##### Branching strategy in each project:
1. Project 2 and 3 will use the Git Flow Branching strategy - The strategy use 5 branches namely the Main, Develop, Feature, Release and Hotfix.
2. Project 4 and 5 will use GitHub Flow Branching Stategy - The is simple and fit the projects since they do not require version control. 

##### .gitignore:
Is a text file use to tell git which file or folders it should ignore when setting the project in the GitHun repository. Examples for .gitignore are *.exe and *.py.

##### Credentials and Sensitivity
They are different license to keep credentiality and the credentials are given based on the license choosen. Repository and Project can be set as private or public depending on how sensitive is the information.

# Project 5

 # CMPG-323-Project-5-32608896

 ## Project Description
The project entails to create a  report using Power BI.The project has High-level metrics, Device    monitoring, Device Registration and Filtering pages
contains visual that can be used by the stakeholders to see the performance of the IOT device registered on various platforms.
 
 ### How the stakeholders should use the report
 
The following page which is the high level metrics page give the stakeholders a summary overview of the important data that could be used to make important decisions.
The page show the count of categories, sub-categories, zone, device, and how many devices are currently active or inactive, also the relationship of the status with the categoryID.

The following second page from the report is the Device Mointoring page that the stakeholders can use to view the devices per category, devices per zone and whih devices are 
online or offline.

The third page from the report is the Device Registration page which the stakeholders can use to view how many devices have been registered over a period of time. They can also view how many categories of devices have been created as well as how many zones contain regitered devices on a timeline.

![Device Registration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110477626/200138331-5f355cf4-b841-4744-8f87-91bdf49f24c9.png)

The last page which is the filtering page allow the stakeholders or user to perform filtering action across the whole report pages. The use can filter device based on category, devices can aslo be filtered beside on paltform and device registratin date.
